# run_analysis.R

This is the R script that performs cleaning and  tidying of the dataset with steps listed below.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each  subject.

The script also does the preparation steps regarding the working directory and downloading the required dataset from the source url.
